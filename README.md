The website design is structured in such a way that it showcases the band's legacy, mainly with regards to the albums, key members of the band, and also explains reasons as to why they are relatable to their fans. The HTML document uses a mix of sections and Flexbox-based layout showing the content in an attractive manner. It fixes the header and navigation at the top of the page, as users need to jump with ease to other sections of the site, like "Albums," "Info & Songs," "Artist & Instrument." The navigation is styled in Linkin Park font for a sleek, edgy design on a dark background.

Each section serves a specific purpose. For example, the section of Albums shows top albums in a responsive grid presenting images and Spotify embeds of each album so that one could listen to music right there. Similarly, in Info and Artist sections, Flexbox is used to place media-such as images or videos-beside text so the content would be easy to read and interact with. It also hosts the creator's information and the credits at the bottom, thereby lending a professional touch to the site.

The CSS file enhances this design through responsiveness, using media queries that change the layout on smaller screens by stacking the contents vertically to improve readability. Linkin Park font is used throughout the design to give it an authentic look and make it cohesive, especially for headers. This contrast of dark background and white text works with the aesthetics of the band, and Flexbox allowed for smooth alignment of text and media. Consequently, it would make the site functional and visually pleasing. Overall, the design dynamically merges modern web technologies with engaging media to celebrate the music and legacy of Linkin Park.
